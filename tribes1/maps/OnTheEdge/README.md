An entertainment map that was originally made as the final challenge for the "Tribal Survivor" challenge back in 2001. You start at the bottom (go figure) and climb your way up through different levels. Each level has a different object you must use to climb up. It gets harder the higher you get, but luckily at the end of each level there is a marker switch. When you tap this switch it saves your position and if you die after hitting it you will respawn there (instead of all the way back down on the bottom). If you're playing with more than one person on the server it's a lot of fun to battle your way to the top (disc people off, etc). Thanks to ^BuGs^ for playtesting and |TIA|Ritz_ for code (the code isn't 100% functional since this didn't actually get used for tribal survivor). Enjoy!
